Learning some new :
.Basics of ECS DOTS in unity
.Animations with a target to focus (easy)
.Classic OBJ Pooling 
.Some simple mechanic to finish the game core mechanics (Infinite game run and pick a champ type to start)

Mainly made to dont get rusty but i liked the part of the DOTS implementation (even if basic)
